The python script defines a neural-network policy for the Half-cheetah environment, and trains both a behavioral cloning and policy DAgger algorithm.
Ensure to import the required libraries to execute the code. Libraries include gymnasium[mujoco], torch, and numpy. You can run the script using $python imitation.py in the terminal
The output includes the loss for each algorithm as well as the video of the Half-Cheetah environment
