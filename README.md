## **Overview**

- The python script defines a neural-network policy for the Half-cheetah environment, trains both a behavioral cloning and policy DAgger algorithm, and outputs a video of each policy applied to the Half-Cheetah environment.

- Ensure to import the required libraries to execute the code. Libraries include gymnasium[mujoco], torch, and numpy.
  
- Run the script using "$python Imitation_Learning.py" in the terminal.
  
- The output includes the loss for each algorithm as well as the video of the Half-Cheetah environment. To follow the cheetah in the video, press the tab key.
